### Warning - This project is on pause!
I've switched to developing a different mod, Never Enough Wikis, so stay tuned for it!

Welcome to Roughly Enough Skyblock (RES), a new Hypixel Skyblock mod for Fabric 1.18.1. 

RES has some basic features, but has a lot more coming! Check out our progress over at [projects](https://github.com/EnyCode/RoughlyEnoughSkyblock/projects/1). 

<hr>

## Features
- Fancy Status Bar
### Upcoming:
- Roughly Enough Items integration
- In-game wiki
- Price tooltips
- Discord Rich Presence
- Events timer
- Fairy soul waypoint

<hr>

## Notes
- Textures for Fancy Bars are taken from FurfSky Reborn's Skyblocker addon, so it's best to use that resource pack
- Some of my code is based off of [Skyblocker LIAP](https://modrinth.com/mod/skyblocker-liap) and [Butter SB](https://modrinth.com/mod/buttersb), so thank you to those two creators!

## Help
I'm not asking for much, but I am not an artist, so I just need help with:
- Vanilla bars texture
- A logo
